# River-Dynamics
This analysis examines river dynamics and land use changes in the Kabul Basin over multiple decades using cloud-free Landsat satellite imagery. It calculates indices like NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) and MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) to classify built-up areas and water bodies, helping identify changes in river extent and surrounding land use. The study visualizes temporal trends in river expansion or reduction and provides a detailed multi-temporal dataset with a legend for interpretation.

Importance of this Analysis:
Water Resource Management: Understanding river dynamics is critical for sustainable water resource planning, especially in water-scarce regions like the Kabul Basin.
Flood Risk Assessment: Identifying changes in river extent helps predict flood-prone areas and mitigate risks.
Urban Development Impact: Monitoring built-up areas and their proximity to rivers evaluates the impact of urbanization on river systems.
Climate Change Implications: Analyzing long-term river trends provides insights into the effects of climate change on hydrological systems.
Environmental Preservation: This analysis aids in designing strategies to protect and restore river ecosystems, crucial for biodiversity and local communities.
Such studies are vital for informed decision-making in environmental conservation, urban planning, and disaster preparedness.
